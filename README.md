# An approach to solve the knapsack problem in Java

The motivation for this project is based on the IT Talents May 2017
[Code Competition](https://www.it-talents.de/foerderung/code-competition/code-competition-05-2017).

## How to compile

The easiest way is to use *Maven* and just run

```bash
mvn package
```

in the root directory. There are some tests that need to pass first, if you want to check them first run

```bash
mvn test
```
